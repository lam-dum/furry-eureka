I have found it
My name is Mohamed Lamin Dumbuya. I am hoping to get my Bachelor's degree in technology.

 I love to make more friends and I like food, music and reading good books. I love music.

I am single.

Am currently a professional Electrician. I am hoping to change my profession soon and start a job that helps with technology and quality assurance.

I love BYU Pathway because it gives me the ability to do my school work at home, which is pretty good for my for my job. I love the dynamics of learning
the gospel simultaneously with the education. 

I see web design as a very up-and-coming skill. I think it will be very beneficial to know for years to come as the world continues to advance and companies are using their own websites to promote their services and products. I have always been interested in learning about technology and coding. 

I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints for many years.
